  <h1>Batches</h1>
  <p>A batch is a collection of isotherms. When you use the modfb-interface to upload new data the interface
  will request a new batch number, and then use this batch number for all isotherms you upload. If you need to you can later
  delete all isotherms in the batch easily. See mofdb-interface for more. This pages is also available at
    <a href="/batches.json">/batches.json</a> in json form.
